# Custom-ui adapted for Home Assistant 110.+

## No more icon_color?
Since Home Assistant saw version 110.+, [icon handling in state-badge](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/issues/5892#issuecomment-630872617) has changed, causing the [original custom-ui](https://github.com/andrey-git/home-assistant-custom-ui) by @andrey-git to no longer be fully functional. 

The loss of icon_color would be a major pain, and reason enough to hold off updating Home Assistant until I would be able to globally colorize my icons again.

Second to that, it was announced that the `extra_html_url` config option was soon to be [deprecated and removed](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/issues/6028). So things had to change.

I rung [the alarmbell](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/issues/5892) on this, and the core Dev team (thanks Bram and Thomas) helped me transform the 'old' state-card-custom-ui.html import into a modern JS version. 

This adapted version makes it compatible again with HA 110+. And allows us to use icon_color like before! Globally.

## Credits
I've been a longtime and heavy user of custom-ui, and this is the place to applaud Andrey for his amazing plugin. Home Assisant wouldn't be the same without the global customizing it enables us to do. Couldn't live without it!
All credits go to Andrey.

## Prepare

-0 Delete all existing references to custom-ui in your current config (or, if you don't trust it, comment them out, as I always do before major changes..) Also, you can delete all old custom-ui files. (Again, for safety: after you have established all is functioning properly with the new setup).

## Installing is super easy:

-1 Create a new folder under your resources folder. Suggestion: custom-ui.

-2 Copy the [custom-ui.js](https://github.com/Mariusthvdb/custom-ui/blob/master/custom-ui.js) file to that folder.

### Using Frontend
This resembles the 'old' was most. You can load the new custom-ui by adding it via [extra_module_url:](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/frontend/#extra_module_url) in the [`frontend:`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/frontend/) section in your configuration.yaml as follows (previously we used `/config/www/custom_ui` but, you can use any folder you like. So why not start using the 'resources' folder we use in Home Assistant nowadays):

   ```yaml
   frontend:
     extra_module_url:
       - /local/lovelace/resources/custom-ui/custom-ui.js
   ```

-4 Restart Home Assistant.

-5 Refresh cache...
You might have to refresh your cache a few times. In my personal experience, especially Safari on the Mac and the iPhone app can be a bit obnoxious....

### Using Resources
-3 Add the following to your [resources.yaml](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/dashboards-and-views/#resources) (adapt to your personal file hierarchy):

   ```yaml
   - url: /local/lovelace/resources/custom-ui/custom-ui.js?v=20200528
     type: module
  ```
-4 Reload the Lovelace resources.
Click the top right Lovelace menu triple dots and Reload resources, or call service `lovelace.reload_resources` in `/developer-tools/service/`.

-5 Refresh Lovelace. 

### Or, use The Modern way: UI
- Click Configuration at `/config/dashboard`, click Lovelace Dashboards, click Resources.
- Click
![configuration-resources](https://github.com/Mariusthvdb/custom-ui/blob/master/add.png)
- Fill out the path in your configuration
- Select `JavaScript Module`
- Create

![configuration-resources](https://github.com/Mariusthvdb/custom-ui/blob/master/configuration-resources.png)

### HACS
As I don't use [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) myself, I won't go into the details of a HACS install, but if you do use HACS, this repo can be added to the custom repositories.

## Check the correct loading of Custom-ui
Having finished the above procedure, you should check if everything went well, and the info screens reflect the newly adapted file as it should. See below:

In `/developer-tools/info`:

![info](https://github.com/Mariusthvdb/custom-ui/blob/master/Developer-tools.png)

In Inspector:

![inspector](https://github.com/Mariusthvdb/custom-ui/blob/master/Module-in-Inspector.png)

In Resources:

![listed](https://github.com/Mariusthvdb/custom-ui/blob/master/listed-resources.png)

-6 If you don't see the above: repeat either 5 until you do. Eventually it will show up (unless there's an error somewhere, which you will see in inspector most likely).

## Finally...drumroll
-7 Happy customizing!


## No more States, Lovelace it is
Note that this adapted version still holds all options of the original custom-ui. Since that was designed for Home Assistant   States, and we now live Lovelace, many of these options are no longer supported or used. I haven't yet streamlined the file to cut out these, as I am not sure whether Lovelace won't ever bring these back. 'Per entity theming' for one was a major feature now defunct.
As are all other features specifically used in the state-cards. Like `show_last_changed`. We all know how to do that easily in Lovelace now. (Note some 'old' functionality can still be seen in the 'more-info' popups.)

For a still valid explanation of the JavaScript templating custom-ui uses, I best simply point you to the [original docs on the subject](https://github.com/andrey-git/home-assistant-custom-ui/blob/master/docs/templates.md).

### More-info
 While you are there, you may have found the [Customizer companion](https://github.com/andrey-git/home-assistant-customizer) too. We used that to hide stuff from the `more-info` windows. This was useful, because we could also hide the templates we set in custom-ui. However, current Lovelace has changed the effect of customizer,
 which stopped customizer from working, resulting in:

![more-info](https://github.com/Mariusthvdb/custom-ui/blob/master/templates-in-more-info.png)

@CAB426 has changed custom-ui.js, so it again allows to hide attributes in `more-info`, and even better, we can now do so using custom-ui.js only.
Customizer companion is no longer needed. This is confirmed to work for HA 0.112+ and can look like:

![more-info](https://github.com/Mariusthvdb/custom-ui/blob/master/hidden-templates-in-more-info.png)

#### Hide attributes
To hide attributes in the `more-info` popup, you need to add the `hide_attribute` customization option under the entity in `customize.yaml` or in the global customize configuration `customize_glob.yaml`. 
Single attributes can be hidden by listing them under the corresponding entity (or global definition) or you can choose to hide all attributes by adding the new `all` entry.

## Learn core Homeassistant customization 
It goes without saying that custom-ui is an extension of core Home Assistant functionality. As such, you should understand what is documented on [Homeassisant.io](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/customizing-devices/) about the subject. 
Important to note, is that Home Assistant [core Jinja templating](https://home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/templating/) is calculated in the back-end, server side, (the device Home Assistant is running on). Javascript templating is calculated in the front-end, browser side, (the device Home Assistant is displayed on). 

Heavy templating might impact the performance of the system and will depend on processor power and memory available on either side of your devices.

## Examples
Some examples, including the newly added option for `hide_attributes` can be found [here](https://github.com/Mariusthvdb/custom-ui/blob/master/examples.yaml).

## Just to be sure....
Don't, let me repeat, Don't use the guidelines from the original repo (I won't provide a link, as you'd probably click it ;-) ) anymore on downloading, installing and activating custom-ui. All of that info now is obsolete. Follow 1 - 6 above and you're set.

## Known error
About `e.push is not a function`. It has been there ever since we used custom-ui in Lovelace. Or at least since a very long time. And has nothing to do with the change for Home Assistant 110+ used in this repo. So never mind. <strike>Or preferably: help me edit the custom-ui.js to prevent it from happening if you feel like it. Most welcome!</strike>
Has been fixed as per version 20200917.
